# ProjectEuler

Project Euler is a set of math-oriented programming problems of increasing difficulty. Often times the solutions require deep mathematical thought; these are more than simple programming exercises. For a person who is interested in mathematics AND programming, Project Euler is a perfect way to pass the time and keep the mind sharp. There are hundreds of problems to solve; I plan to chip away at this problem set for years to come. I seek to optimize the problems that intrigue me; for the problems that are less exciting I simply give a solution which is sufficient. My only motivation for doing these problems is FUN and KNOWLEDGE, so if you have any questions or advice about any of my solutions, please let me know (:
